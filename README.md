# UFO

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. This analysis is made possible by building an html page that will allow us to pull, create, and use filters of data from JavaScript files. In addition to the date, you’ll be able to filter the data by city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.

### HTML Page (Title and Article)

## Results 
The html page will have an opening article to get the client engaged with evidence found about aliens’ existence. The user will have the ability to search and filter all the results provided from our source data on supporting evidence of alien sightings. The user will have the option to filter by date, city, state, country and shape of the UFO sighting. Comments are provided as well to give more context to each occurrence. 


## Summary
This page provides many occurrences of UFO sightings and can be used to provide a strong argument that aliens exist. One problem that can arise with a webpage such as this is validity of the information. We have many different instances, but not the number of observers or other pieces of evidence that would support these sightings. Creating a more interactive page could possibly get the users more involved and create a blog environment that would lead to more users and in turn share more information or evidence supporting each instance.
